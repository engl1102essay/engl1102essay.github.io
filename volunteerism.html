								<p>The method of military service employed in the societies in the two novels differ substantially. While Heinlein stresses volunteering for the military in the Terran Federation, Haldeman employs a conscription model based on skill and intelligence. In Starship Troopers, the military strictly recruits on a volunteer basis. It is every person’s right to choose to join the military at age 18, the once decision they have full right to make. “When a boy, or a girl, reaches his or her eighteenth birthday, he or she can volunteer and nobody else has any say in the matter” (Heinlein, 26). No one is drafted into the job, because the Terran Federation values the intrinsic will to fight for the Federation—that’s something that cannot be taught, but must be developed by the individual. Once a person joins, they recite an oath which outlines each of their responsibilities and consequences for their actions. In addition, there is no penalty for leaving service; whenever they wanted to quit, they could.</p>
								<h4>“Ability to leave the military at will: “Some of them were dropped without prejudice and allowed, if they wished, to sweat out their terms in the noncombatant services; others got Bad Conduct Discharges, or Unsatisfactory Performance Discharges, or Medical Discharges. Usually you didn't know why a man left unless you saw him leave and he volunteered the information. But some of them got fed up, said so loudly, and resigned, forfeiting forever their chances of franchise” (Chapter 4).</h4>
								<p>In The Forever War, there is no choice. The entire military is composed of drafted and well-qualified individuals, creating objectively the best army from the country. Once an individual is brought onboard, they cannot leave. This causes citizens to stop studying or working, changing the course of their lives entirely. It is important to note that the military draft is measured through both physical and intelligent tasks, making the military exceptional in the objective sense.</p>
								<h4>Build resentment towards the military: “So here we were, fifty men and fifty women, with IQs over 150 and bodies of unusual health and strength, slogging cutely through the mud and slush of central Missouri, reflecting on the usefulness of our skill in building bridges on worlds where the only fluid is an occasional standing pool of liquid helium.” (Chapter 2)</h4>
								<p>While this kind of filtration does cause the military to be the best physically and intellectually, the members (most of them, at least) lack the passion and internal drive to serve. This is arguably as important as the other two facets of skill, as it motivates the soldiers to apply their full physical stamina and intellectual strategy.</p>
								<p>The difference in military recruitment methods is related to the purpose of military in these novels. The Starship Troopers is pro-war, and joining the army is portrayed as a great idea. Specifically in the novel, Johnnie Rico’s main motive at the time of joining is to impress Carmen and to do something for himself. He does it almost on a whim, initially motivated just because his friend is joining. For Mandella, joining the military is not a decision. He is not excited and lacks a motive. In fact, he hates the entire idea of the army.</p>
								<h4>“I was disgusted with the human race, disgusted with the army and horrified at the prospect of living with myself for another century” (Chapter 14).</h4>
								<p>Mandella represents the anti-war stance in this book, emphasizing the difficulties, inefficiencies, and troubles of war.</p>
