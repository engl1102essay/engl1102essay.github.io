								<h3>Volunteerism</h3>
								<p>The concept of volunteerism is something that varies greatly between the two books that we have read. While Starship Troopers stresses volunteering, The Forever War downplays it.</p>
								<p>In Starship Troopers, the military strictly recruits on a volunteer basis. Anyone can join the military if they choose to. Once they do, they are asked to recite an oath which outlines that each of them are going to be responsible for their own actions. And, whenever the soldiers wanted to, they were free to leave.</p>
								<p>“Ability to leave the military at will: “Some of them were dropped without prejudice and allowed, if they wished, to sweat out their terms in the noncombatant services; others got Bad Conduct Discharges, or Unsatisfactory Performance Discharges, or Medical Discharges.</p>
								<p>Usually you didn't know why a man left unless you saw him leave and he volunteered the information. But some of them got fed up, said so loudly, and resigned, forfeiting forever their chances of franchise” (Chapter 4). In The Forever War, there is no choice. Once you are drafted you are in regardless of what the situation maybe. Some of the recruits were studying and working but they were taken anyways.  Also, not anyone can get in. You need to be the brightest and most talented individuals.</p>
								<p>Build resentment towards the military: “So here we were, fifty men and fifty women, with IQs over 150 and bodies of unusual health and strength, slogging cutely through the mud and slush of central Missouri, reflecting on the usefulness of our skill in building bridges on worlds where the only fluid is an occasional standing pool of liquid helium.” (Chapter 2)</p>
								<p>The primary reason for this difference is the fact that the wars are described for different reason. While in Starship Troopers, the tone is pro-war, so joining the army is a great idea. Johnnie Rico’s main motive for instance is to impress Carmen. He did not have to think about anything before joining. For Mandella, it was a little different. He was not excited to join and he did not have a motive to join. In fact he hated the entire idea of the army.</p>
								<p>Consequence of conscripted military: “I was disgusted with the human race, disgusted with the army and horrified at the prospect of living with myself for another century” (Chapter 14) Mandella represented an anti war stance in this book. He is trying to emphasize that war is not an easy commitment to make.</p>
