								<h4>Consent</h4>
								<p>The next main idea is consent given to women. Stemming of the idea of having an opportunity to determine consequence is the idea of consent. Similar to how Starship Troopers gave more opportunities for the recruits to choose what they want to do, they were also more respectful of consent. The Forever War tried to have a focus on consent but they were not able to really follow through.</p>
								<p>An example is seen through the consent women have to give to have sex. Yes it is their “choice” but at the end this idea is enforced by the military law that is provided in the book. “The orgy that night was amusing, but it was like trying to sleep in the middle of a raucous beach party. The only area big enough to sleep all of us was the dining hall; they draped a few bedsheets here and there for privacy, then unleashed Stargate's eighteen sex-starved men on our women, compliant and promiscuous by military custom (and law), but desiring nothing so much as sleep on solid ground.” (Chapter 10).</p>
								<p>Although in Starship Troopers  no direct concept of consent is referred to the women have a choice about the relationships and ambitions they want to pursue. Carmen had total control over her relationships and chose to be a pilot. However, as in The Forever War the main source of control and order was bound by law, in Starship Troopers, it was bound by the idea of corporal punishment. This difference is notable in the consequence of the war that was being fought. The recruits were already smart in The Forever War a little conditioning was not going to change who they were. So violence was not as much of a clear option as it was in Starship Troopers.</p>
								<p>In Starship Troopers, the recruits were asked to read books and plays that discussed aspects of law and morale so they could develop themselves. This was unlike The Forever War, so the focus for these smart individuals was on military law.</p>
