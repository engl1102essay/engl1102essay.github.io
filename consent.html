								<p>In addition to the <a href="volunteerism.html">method of recruitment</a>, the focus on military is extended by the treatment of women and sexual relations. This plays a role in the amount of control the people of the society are given in determining their lives. Similar to how <i>Starship Troopers</i> gave more opportunities for the constituents to determine their status with the military, they are also more respectful of consent. <i>The Forever War</i> emulates a cover of consent, while actually enforcing sex. While it is their “choice,” the military law requires it and the culture is essentially built up to it.</p>
								<h4>“The orgy that night was amusing, but it was like trying to sleep in the middle of a raucous beach party. The only area big enough to sleep all of us was the dining hall; they draped a few bedsheets here and there for privacy, then unleashed Stargate's eighteen sex-starved men on our women, compliant and promiscuous by military custom (and law), but desiring nothing so much as sleep on solid ground.” (Chapter 10).</h4>
								<p>While there is no direct concept of consent discussed in <i>Starship Troopers</i>, the women clearly have a choice about the relationships and ambitions they pursue. The prime example in the novel is Carmen, who chooses to be a pilot. There is very brief mention of her romantic pursuits, but the one time she asks Johnnie on a date it is a big deal to him. In fact, women have full control and their relationships, and men are considered almost lucky to get their attention. This is, in part, a product of their natural lack of exposure to women, but also demonstrates the respect.</p>
								<p>Unlike this level of control, <i>The Forever War</i> portrays a society in which the women’s main source of control and order was bound by law. In <i>Starship Troopers</i>, it was bound by the idea of corporal punishment. This difference is notable in the consequence of the war that was being fought. The recruits were already smart in <i>The Forever War</i>, and corporal punishment would not bring them into line. In <i>Starship Troopers</i>, however, much more training is required to form good soldiers. The recruits were asked to read books and plays that discussed aspects of law and morale so they could develop themselves, whereas in <i>The Forever War</i>, the focus for these smart individuals was on military law.</p>
