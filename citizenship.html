								<p align="right">Overall, both books have a different stance on citizenship and the idea of pro-war and anti-war. Starship Troopers had a more pro-war focus. Everyone was supporting their war efforts and collaborating for for the duty to the country.</p>
								<p align="right">“Everybody, male or female, shall have his born right to pay his service and assume full citizenship” (Chapter 2) Some people’s objective was to gain the rights to citizenship and this could clearly only be done by participating in the military. Joining the military gave the recruits a collection of rights that the could not have recieved another way had they wanted to.</p>
								<p>“Had I ever cared about voting? No, it was the prestige, the pride, the status... of being a citizen” (Chapter 11). The Forever War , as mentioned previously has that strong anti war stance. The focus was more on looking at the downsides of joining the military and the full experience. This also ends up acknowledging the idea of the experience which  soldiers  face when they return home. All the things they have forgotten or missed at their times of service which the Starship Troopers fails to mention. I think the key difference is the use of time dilation which is not as much of impact as it in Starship Troopers. Haldeman’s objective was to show the idea that the Vietnam War was long and completely unnecessary. Heinlein was not showing that aspect of war.</p>
